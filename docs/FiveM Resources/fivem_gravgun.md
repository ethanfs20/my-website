## Description

Think Half-Life 2, but in Los Santos! This script allows players to equip a "gravity gun" that can manipulate and control entities within the game world. The functionality can be triggered using the 'E' key when aiming at an entity, with the scroll wheel adjusting the entity's distance from the player.

## Features

- Control and manipulate in-game entities using a "gravity gun" mechanic.
- Adjust the distance of controlled entities using the mouse scroll wheel.
- Intuitive controls using the 'E' key and free aim.

## Installation

1. Download the `GravityGun` script from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/ethanfs20/GravityGun).
2. Place the `GravityGun` folder in your FiveM server's resource directory.
3. Add `ensure GravityGun` to your `server.cfg` file.

## Usage

Equip your pistol and free aim at an entity. Hit 'E' to start controlling the entity. The scroll wheel will let you adjust how far the entity is from you. Hit 'E' again when you're ready to let the entity go.
